# Classification Projects
## What is classification and what does it mean to perform a classification model?
	 CLASSIFICATION  is a Supervised Machine Learning technique for determining 
     the class which the dependent variable belongs to based on the one or more
     independent variables.
     Classification is used for predicting discrete responses .

## Roadmap

+++++++++++++A STAR IS APPRECIATED++++++++++++++

Before we jump right into programming, we should lay out a brief guide to keep us on track. The following steps form the basis for any machine learning workflow once we have a problem and model in mind :

    1.State the question and determine required data
    2.Acquire the data in an accessible format
    3.Identify and correct missing data points/anomalies as required
    4.Prepare the data for the machine learning model
    5.Establish a baseline model that you aim to exceed
    6.Train the model on the training data
    7.Make predictions on the test data
    8.Compare predictions to the known test set targets and calculate performance metrics
    9.If performance is not satisfactory, adjust the model, acquire more data, or try a different modeling technique
    10.Interpret model and report results visually and numerically
